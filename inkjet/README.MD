## I have a consumer inkjet printer. give me tips for dealing with the cartridges

1. Print a colored test page every 14 days. If not used _~ for three months ~_ cartridges dry out and are shown as "empty".
2. Ignore "low ink" warnings, print until the actual quality drops.
3. Disable rebooting/shutdowns in printer settings, which wastes ink on "cleaning".
4. Don't take out or swap cartridges, the firmware can lock them.
5. (when purchased in the EU) Disable "Economy" or "Draft" modes, in the printer settings and the driver on windows.

## Cartridges are so expensive, can i buy non-official cartridges?

1. Buy third-party or refilled colors & black cartridges for your **printer model**.
   - Amazon
   - eBay
2. Block the printer from **internet access**, but not LAN (WiFi printing), in your home router. _This prevents the vendor from eventually disabling those cartridges with a "firmware update"._
