You’re in great shape 🎉 — TLS good, rDNS good, SPF/DKIM/DMARC good, SMTP/IMAP listening, Cloudflare proxy (orange cloud) off for mail. Here’s the “keep it healthy + hard to break” checklist I’d keep:

### 1) Patch & update

* **Debian**: `apt-get update && apt-get upgrade` and enable unattended upgrades.
* **mox**: turn on its built-in update pings: in `config/mox.conf` set
  `CheckUpdates: true`, then `systemctl restart mox`.
* Reboot after kernel updates.

### 2) SSH + firewall basics

* Switch to **SSH keys**, then in `/etc/ssh/sshd_config`:
  `PasswordAuthentication no`, `PermitRootLogin prohibit-password`, `AllowUsers <youruser>`.
* **UFW** tight allowlist (IPv4/IPv6):
  `ufw default deny incoming`
  `ufw allow 22,25,80,443,465,993/tcp`
  (Add `587` only if you decide to run STARTTLS submission too.)
* Keep the **admin/webmail on localhost** only (you already do; access via SSH tunnel).

### 3) Unbound: don’t be an open resolver

Lock Unbound to loopback so the world can’t query it:

```
cat >/etc/unbound/unbound.conf.d/loopback-only.conf <<'EOF'
server:
    interface: 127.0.0.1
    interface: ::1
    access-control: 127.0.0.0/8 allow
    access-control: ::1 allow
    access-control: 0.0.0.0/0 refuse
    access-control: ::0/0 refuse
EOF
systemctl restart unbound
```

(You already have DNSSEC validation + `options trust-ad` — perfect.)

### 4) TLS/MTA-STS & DNS hygiene

* Once you’re confident, switch **MTA-STS** policy from `testing` to `enforce` and bump `max_age` (e.g. 1–4 weeks).
* **DNSSEC**: after the DS record finishes propagating, leave it on.
* Optional later: add **DANE (TLSA)** once DNSSEC is fully live; it’s extra safety for senders that support it.
* Raise TTLs (MX/SPF/DKIM/etc.) from 300s to something saner (e.g. 3600–14400) once stable.

### 5) Account & auth hygiene

* Use long, unique passwords. Clients should be set to **“SSL/TLS”** on 465 and **IMAPS** on 993.
* Don’t enable plaintext auth without TLS. (mox defaults are safe.)
* Consider a separate “**alias catch-all = off**” policy; only create the addresses you actually use.

### 6) Backups (do this!)

Back up **/usr/local/mail/config** and **/usr/local/mail/data** regularly (that’s your mail, accounts, DKIM, and ACME state). Example with restic (to any S3/back-end):

```
restic backup /usr/local/mail/config /usr/local/mail/data /etc/unbound /etc/systemd/system/mox.service
```

Test a restore once.

### 7) Monitoring & abuse reports

* In the **Admin UI**, use the DNS/TLS checks occasionally.
* Read **DMARC aggregate** and **TLSRPT** reports (they flag spoofing/TLS issues).
* Keep an eye on queues and logs:
  `journalctl -u mox -f` and `mox config dnscheck yourdomain`.

### 8) DDoS & brute-force reality check

* Volumetric DDoS on 25/465/993 can’t be proxied via Cloudflare; you mostly rely on **Hetzner’s network** capacity. Keep services minimal (only the needed ports).
* Light connection limiting can help with brute-force (be conservative to avoid hurting legit mail). Example idea if you later use `nftables`: per-IP connection caps on 25/465/993. Not mandatory; mox already does sane throttling.
* For SSH, add **fail2ban** (only for sshd) to reduce password spray if you keep password auth enabled (ideally disable it).

### 9) Reputation & deliverability

* New domain/IPs carry less trust. Warm up slowly, avoid bulk/marketing, keep content clean.
* If a real blocklist hit appears, follow their removal process; avoid listing yourself by running an open resolver or open relay (you’re not).

### 10) Key rotation plan

* You already have DKIM `2025a`/`2025b`. Each year: publish a new selector (e.g. `2026a`), sign with it, keep the old one published for a few months, then retire.

#### Can you be DDoSed or hacked?

* **DDoS:** yes, like any Internet service. Your best mitigations at this layer are minimal exposed surface, good firewalling, and a provider with decent upstream protections.
* **Compromise risk:** mainly via weak creds, outdated software, or exposed admin surfaces. Keys + updates + local-only admin + backups are your best defense.

If you want, I can turn this into a tiny **Ansible** playbook or a one-page **runbook** you keep with commands and paths.
