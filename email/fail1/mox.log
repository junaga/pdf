Checking if DNS resolvers are DNSSEC-verifying... OK
Looking up IPs for hostname host.stanew.name...

NOTE: It looks like the DNS records of your domain (zone) are not DNSSEC-signed.
Mail servers that send email to your domain, or receive email from your domain,
cannot verify that the MX/SPF/DKIM/DMARC/MTA-STS records they receive are
authentic. DANE, for authenticated delivery without relying on a pool of
certificate authorities, requires DNSSEC, so will not be configured at this
time.
Recommended action: Continue now, but consider enabling DNSSEC for your domain
later at your DNS operator, and adding DANE records for protecting incoming
messages over SMTP.

Checking if outgoing smtp connections can be made by connecting to gmail.com mx on port 25... OK

Checking if domain stanew.name was registered recently... 2 days (recent!)
WARNING: Mail servers may treat messages coming from recently registered domains
(in the order of weeks to months) with suspicion, with higher probability of
messages being classified as junk.

Checking whether host name IPs are listed in popular DNS block lists...
WARNING: checking your public IP 2a01:4f8:c17:7b0c::1 in DNS block list sbl.spamhaus.org: fail Error: open resolver; https://check.spamhaus.org/returnc/pub/2a01:4f8:0:a104::add:1d/

Other mail servers are likely to reject email from IPs that are in a blocklist.
If all your IPs are in block lists, you will encounter problems delivering
email. Your IP may be in block lists only temporarily. To see if your IPs are
listed in more DNS block lists, visit:
